Here's an example of what a Graphic Novelist script looks like:

    @ Title:    Moonkin P.I.
    @ Subtitle: The Case of Rick Rachette's Gilded Gizmo
    @ Author:   Matt McCray
    @ Revision: First Draft

    [Page #]

    Panel # - Opening shot is of a teepee with a sign out front reading 
    "Darkshore Detectives Inc." Beneath, in smaller hand written letters, 
    "No quest too small."
    
    A satyr is picking up a newspaper from the yard.


    [Page #]

    Panel # - Ville, a Moonkin, is sitting at his desk drinking from a mug.
    Pete, a Satyr, has just entered their office/teepee.

      VILLE: Pete, being a detective sucks.
      PETE: How would you know, Ville? We've never had a single job.
      VILLE: Yeah, that's why it sucks.

    Panel # - Pete walks over to the coffee maker, we see Ville in the 
    background, head in hand.

      VILLE: It's the stupid questers! They keep taking all our potential jobs.
             They work for nearly nothing too! It's completely crashing the
             P.I. market.

    Panel # - Pete sits down at his desk.

      PETE: So true.
      VILLE: We need to be more aggressive about leads. 
             When we get one, we need to pounce on it!

    Panel #

      PETE: (offhand) Speaking of which, I think I found a new lead.
      VILLE: Really?

    Panel #
    
      PETE: Yes. I heard old man Rachette lost something and needs it found.
      VILLE: That old gnome, really? You're not just saying that to cheer
             me up, are you?
    
    Panel #
    
      PETE: Are you kidding? I like you more when you're depressed. You have
            far less unfounded optimism.
    
    Panel # - Ville jumps up.
    
      VILLE: Well then, what are we waiting for? We need to talk to him before
             one of those questers beats us to him! 
    
    Panel # - Ville gets a dreamy look to his eyes.
    
      VILLE: He'll hire us, of course, and we'll finally be official detectives!
             It'll be so great!
    
    Panel #
    
      PETE: Uh huh. Just like that.
    
    Panel # - Pete and Ville walking out of the teepee...
    
      PETE: I wonder if there are detective groupies?
