## Example

Here's an example of what a Graphic Novelist script look like:

    @ Title:    Moonkin P.I.
    @ Subtitle: The Case of Rick Rachette's Gilded Gizmo
    @ Author:   Matt McCray
    @ Revision: First Draft

    [Page #]

    Panel # - Opening shot is of a teepee with a sign out front reading "Darkshore Detectives Inc." Beneath, in smaller hand written letters, "No quest too small."
    
    A satyr is picking up a newspaper from the yard.


    [Page #]

    Panel # - Ville, a Moonkin, is sitting at his desk drinking from a mug. Pete, a Satyr, has just entered their office/teepee.

      VILLE: Pete, being a detective sucks.
      PETE: How would you know, Ville? We've never had a single job.
      VILLE: Yeah, that's why it sucks.

    Panel # - Pete walks over to the coffee maker, we see Ville in the background, head in hand.

      VILLE: It's the stupid questers! They keep taking all our potential jobs.
      VILLE: They work for nearly nothing too! It's completely crashing the P.I. market.

    Panel # - Pete sits down at his desk.

      PETE: So true.
      VILLE: We need to be more aggressive about leads. When we get one, we need to pounce on it!

    Panel #

      PETE: Speaking of which, I think I found a new lead.
      VILLE: Really?
